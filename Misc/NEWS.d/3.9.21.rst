.. release date: 2024-12-03
.. section: Tests

Re-enable skipped tests for :mod:`zlib` on the s390x architecture: only skip
checks of the compressed bytes, which can be different between zlib's
software implementation and the hardware-accelerated implementation.

.. section: Tests

Fix ``test_socket.test_hmac_sha1()`` in FIPS mode. Use a longer key: FIPS
mode requires at least of at least 112 bits. The previous key was only 32
bits. Patch by Victor Stinner.

.. section: Security

Changed IPv4-mapped ``ipaddress.IPv6Address`` to consistently use the mapped
IPv4 address value for deciding properties. Properties which have their
behavior fixed are ``is_multicast``, ``is_reserved``, ``is_link_local``,
``is_global``, and ``is_unspecified``.

Add checks to ensure that ``[`` bracketed ``]`` hosts found by
:func:`urllib.parse.urlsplit` are of IPv6 or IPvFuture format.

.. section: Documentation

Clarified the conflicting advice given in the :mod:`ast` documentation about
:func:`ast.literal_eval` being "safe" for use on untrusted input while at
the same time warning that it can crash the process. The latter statement is
true and is deemed unfixable without a large amount of work unsuitable for a
bugfix. So we keep the warning and no longer claim that ``literal_eval`` is
safe.
